# Pre-Built Home Assistant (Hassio) Virtual Machine

If you want to start right away you can download my pre-built and ready-to-use Ubuntu Virtual Machine with Home Assistant v0.107.7 (with Hassio Supervisor), compatible with VMware and VirtualBox.

This VM is built using the Ubuntu MinimalCD and it has no GUI, to keep size to a minimum.
